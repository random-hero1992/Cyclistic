# Cyclistic Case Study
This is a case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course.  The Case Study 1.pdf contains the directions for the project.  Data processing was performed using Pyspark in a Jupyter Notebook.  Data analysis was performed using RStudio.  My results are organized into an R Markdown file.

Credit goes to Lebap Akmyradov for assistance with data processing and analysis.

*This was my first case study as well as my first use case for uploading a project to GitHub.  Comments and feedback are welcome if I'm doing something wrong.  Thanks!
